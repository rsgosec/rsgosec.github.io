                <h3>Why Security</h3>
                <p>The assets with the greatest value are bank accounts, personnel details, intellectual property,
                    and methods and processes of working.
                    These assets have value to, and are coveted by bad faith actors, whether they perform corporate
                    espionage or other mercenary attacks, targeted or opportunistic ransomware or data theft attacks.<br />
                    A good security implementation with wide coverage will mitigate most of these attacks.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At the technology level we have anti-virus/spam/malware, intrusion detection and prevention,
                        and endpoint security toolsets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the human level we have education to raise awareness of social engineering methods
                        and how to mitigate them, and spotting indicators of bad faith communications.<br />
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Why Security?  To retain ownership of your assets.</p>

                <h3>Why Governance</h3>
                <p>
                    Governance provides assurance that the capital expended on the services that secure your
                    assets is being utilised fully and correctly.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By fully, are you getting the best value for your expenditure?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By correctly, were the services providing what was needed then, and are they providing
                        what is needed now?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Why governance? Assure that the services were, are, and will be performant.</p>
