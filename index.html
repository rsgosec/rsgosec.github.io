                    <h3>Why Security</h3>
                    <p>The assets with the greatest value are bank accounts, personnel details, intellectual property,
                        and methods and processes of working.
                        These assets have value to, and are coveted by bad faith actors, whether they perform corporate
                        espionage or other mercenary attacks, targeted or opportunistic ransomware or data theft attacks.<br />
                        A good security implementation with wide coverage will mitigate most of these attacks.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            At the technology level we have anti-virus/spam/malware, intrusion detection and prevention,
                            and endpoint security toolsets.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At the human level we have education to raise awareness of social engineering methods
                            and how to mitigate them, and spotting indicators of bad faith communications.<br />
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Why Security?  To retain ownership of your assets.</p>

                    <h3>Why Governance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Governance provides assurance that the capital expended on services for your
                        assets are being utilised fully and correctly.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            By fully, are you getting the best value for your expenditure?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By correctly, are they configured optimally?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Why governance? Assure that the services were, are, and will be performant.</p>

                    <p>
                        <blockquote>
                            On September 30th, 2025, the legacy multifactor authentication and
                            self-service password reset policies will be deprecated
                        </blockquote>
                        It is important to manage the preparation and migration of authentication
                        and self-service password reset methods in Microsoft Entra, formerly AzureAD,
                        to ensure that your user-base is not impacted by the blanket migration due
                        September 30th, 2025.

                    <h3>Yahoo and Google DKIM email authentication enforcement.</h3>
                    <h5>2024-04-12 Roy Stapleton</h5>
                    <p>
                        Yahoo and Google recently introduced a requirement for sending email
                        servers to authenticate their emails with DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)
                        and SPF (Sender Policy Framework), and advertising their policies using DMARC
                        (Domain-based Message Authentication and Reporting Conformance).
                        The SPF and DMARC policies, and the DKIM message authentication public keys
                        to authenticate received emails are advertised using DNS records.
                        Without these conifgurations Yahoo and Google will reject your emails.
